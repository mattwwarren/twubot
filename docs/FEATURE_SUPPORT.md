## Features: How to request and how to support?

### Requesting Features

This is the easy part! Head on over to [github](https://github.com/mattwwarren/twubot/issues) and open an issue!

Once it is open, one of the maintainers will tag it appropriately as a community request and may ask for more details. Details are important so the more specific you can be up-front, the easier and faster it will be to implement your request!

### Greasing the wheels

This project is just starting up and so it's currently supported by free time. As we all know, life happens sometimes and free time can be rare. Want to motivate us further? Drop a comment on an issue that you'd like to help motivate us!

***Motivation includes***
but is not limited to:

* money
* shoutouts on stream, twitter, facebook etc
* IOUs for beverages at TwitchCon
* A :+1: or :thumbsup: on the original comment

***Not great motivation***

* Saying you'll go somewhere else
* WRITING MEAN THINGS IN ALL CAPS
* Not responding to comments for clarification

### No money? No Followers? No problem!

Don't worry, you don't need to give us anything to get your stuff done. If it's simple and you want to learn, you can also help us by contributing your own time!
