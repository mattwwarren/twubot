## Running twitch-hubot Locally

You can start twubot locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output about where your scripts come from and a
prompt:

    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading adapter shell
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/scripts
    [Sun, 04 Dec 2011 18:41:11 GMT] INFO Loading scripts from /home/tomb/Development/hubot/src/scripts
    twubot>

From here you can start typing commands as you would in chat

    twubot> !bankhack 100
    twubot> Sorry, the heat is too hot. Stay out of the kitchen!
