# INSTALLING

This is not a terribly complicated thing to install. Any acceptable release should be capable of running on Heroku. Since I am not a Heroku master, I ask you to follow their instructions for running a node process.

### Configuration

You will need the following options in order to run this hubot.

* `HUBOT_TWITCH_USERNAME` - Username of your bot
* `HUBOT_TWITCH_PASSWORD` - should be generated by the [Twitch Chat OAuth Password Generator](http://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
* `HUBOT_TWITCH_CHANNELS` - Generally #yourtwitchusername
* `HUBOT_TWITCH_OWNERS` - your username

***NOTE*** - If you use a different user for your bot, make sure you are logged into that user when you generate the password

### Local installation and running

The above configuration should be saved in source.sh

Example:

    export HUBOT_TWITCH_USERNAME="tinkywinky"
    export HUBOT_TWITCH_PASSWORD="oauth:crazylongsetofcharactersfromthatsite"
    export HUBOT_TWITCH_CHANNELS="#tinkywinky"
    export HUBOT_TWITCH_OWNERS="tinkywinky"

1. Clone the repo (again, I assume you can follow other instructions for this)
1. `npm install`
1. `source source.sh`
1. `bin/hubot -a twitch-adapter`

### Extended Configuration

The various plugins provided have some additional configuration parameters. None of these are required but some are suggested.

`HUBOT_TWITCH_ADMINS` - comma-separated list of usernames you want to have admin access to your bot
`HUBOT_BANKHACK_TIMEOUT` - Interval on which to run bankhack in minutes (default: 15)
`HUBOT_BANKHACK_WAGER_TIME` - Time to allow Bankhack wagers in minutes (default: 2)
`HUBOT_BANKHACK_WIN` - desired win percentage of bankhack (default: 50)
`HUBOT_BANKHACK_MULTIPLIER` - multiple for bankhack winnings (default: 2)
`HUBOT_CREDITS_PER_X` - number of credits to distribute every interval
`HUBOT_CREDITS_TIMEOUT` - time interval between credit dispersal in minutes
