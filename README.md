[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattwwarren/twubot.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/mattwwarren/twubot)

twitch-hubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality he has, etc!

### Local execution

Please refer to the doc on [running locally](RUNNING_LOCALLY.md)

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to
get started, along with the [Scripting Guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/scripting.md).

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
the thing.

### external-scripts

Hubot is able to load scripts from third-party `npm` package. Check the package's documentation, but in general it is:

1. Add the packages as dependencies into your `package.json`
2. `npm install` to make sure those packages are installed
3. Add the package name to `external-scripts.json` as a double quoted string

You can review `external-scripts.json` to see what is included by default.

##  Persistence

Twubot has a special access interface to the brain to cut down on some of the edge cases encountered in its development

Please refer to the example in `scripts/example.coffee` for how to use the brain properly. Failure to follow
this pattern will result in loss of data.

## Adapters

Twubot is designed to run on Twitch by default. It can also connect to YouTube Live
and Discord to provide the same functionality across multiple platforms.

There are plans to add more in the near future.

If you wish to run it on a new platform, you are welcome to find/write a compatible adapter.
Run `npm install --save <adpater package name>` to install it and then run hubot with the adapter.

    % bin/hubot -a <adapter>

Where `<adapter>` is the name of your adapter without a `hubot-` prefix.
